# Shopping Trends Analysis

Welcome to the **Shopping Trends Analysis** repository! This project leverages data analysis techniques to uncover patterns, trends, and insights into consumer shopping behaviors. By exploring and visualizing key metrics, the project aims to help businesses and individuals make data-driven decisions.

## 📂 Project Overview

This repository contains an end-to-end analysis of shopping trends using Python. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to highlight insights into customer behavior, product popularity, and seasonal trends.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Data Cleaning:** Handles missing values, outliers, and formatting issues in raw datasets.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifies shopping patterns and key insights.
- **Data Visualization:** Uses libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create meaningful visualizations.
- **Insights Generation:** Extracts actionable insights to support decision-making in retail and e-commerce.

## 📑 Contents

- `data/`: Sample datasets used for analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks containing the EDA and analysis workflows.
- `src/`: Python scripts for data processing and visualization.
